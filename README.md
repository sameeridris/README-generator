The user needs to clone the repository to their local machine, navigate to the project directory, and install the dependencies.

Other people could fork the repository, clone their fork,  create a new branch,  make changes, test the changes, commit their changes, push to their fork, and create a pull request.

Install Jest as a development dependency, write test cases and use npm test.
